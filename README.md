It's in its early stages, please [report
issues](https://github.com/xixiaofinland/afmt/issues)
and we will fix them asap!

# âœ¨ vs. Prettier Apex

While currently showing minor formatting differences, the tools fundamentally
diverge in their design philosophy. Prettier Apex maintains an opinionated
approach to code formatting, whereas afmt is designed with extensibility
in mind.

This means afmt will progressively introduce more configuration
options, addressing user customization needs that Prettier's design
intentionally avoids.
